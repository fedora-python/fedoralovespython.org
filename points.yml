    Fedora helps lead the Python 3 Porting Efforts&trade;.
    Major OS components are already running on Python 3 and more than a half
    of Python packages in the repos are Python 3 compatible.

    When you install Fedora Workstation or Cloud, there's no Legacy Python
    installed by default.
    However `/usr/bin/python` remains Python 2, as described in
    [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/).
