    Programming for computers and servers can be fun, but what about controlling much smaller devices such as BBC micro:bit, boards with the ESP8266 chip or pyboard? With Fedora, you have everything you need, and the world of the Internet of things is opened for you.

    Even without the actual device, you can run MicroPython on Fedora to test your code, it's there, ready for you in the repos.

    Fedora helps lead the Python 3 Porting Efforts&trade;.
    Major OS components are already running on Python 3 and more than a half
    of Python packages in the repos are Python 3 compatible.

    When you install Fedora Workstation or Cloud, there's no Legacy Python
    installed by default.
    However, `/usr/bin/python` remains Python 2, as described in
    [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/).

    Not only Fedora is great for doing Python, important parts of Fedora are
    actually written in it.
    Whether it's the Anaconda system installer, the DNF package manager 
    or the kernel... just kidding, the kernel is not written in Python.

    The majority of Fedora infrastructure, where the distribution is actually
    being created, runs on Python as well. All Open Source, as we love it.
