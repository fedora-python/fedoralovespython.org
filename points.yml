    On Fedora, Python comes pre-installed with first class support for Python
    virtual environments. It is ready for use straight out of the box.
    No guessing package names, no installation, just dive in and go. Look:

        [fedora]$ python3 -m venv env
        [fedora]$ . env/bin/activate
        (env) [fedora]$ python ...

    Fedora repositories include many versions of Python: CPython in multiple
    3.X and 2.X versions, PyPy 2 and 3, Jython and even MicroPython.
    Testing Python code on different interpreters has never been easier.

    You can `sudo dnf install` the Python you need, or you can install a bunch of them
    with `sudo dnf install tox`.

    There are lot of libraries for scientific computation and visualization
    available in Fedora. The most well known and widely used one is SciPy Stack
    which consists of Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook,
    IPython, Pandas, SymPy and more.
    It's easy, and there is no need to compile stuff.

    Programming for computers and servers can be fun, but what about
    controlling much smaller devices such as the BBC micro:bit, boards with
    the ESP8266 chip or pyboards? With Fedora, you have everything you need
    to join the universe that is the Internet of Things.

    Even if you don't have the actual device, you can run MicroPython on Fedora
    to test your code. It's there and ready for you in the repos.

    Fedora helps lead the Python 3 Porting Efforts™.
    Major OS components are already running on Python 3 and more than 80%
    of the Python packages in the repos are Python 3 compatible.

    When you install Fedora, there's no Legacy Python installed by default.

    Starting with Fedora 31, the `python` command (`/usr/bin/python`) is
    Python 3.

    Not only is Fedora great for coding in Python, but, important parts of
    Fedora are actually written in it.
    Python powers the Anaconda system installer, the DNF package manager 
    and the kernel ... Just kidding, the kernel is not written in Python yet.

    The majority of Fedora's infrastructure, where the distribution is actually
    being created, runs on Python as well. All Open Source, as we love it.

    We're Python Special Interest Group,
    and we're making Fedora an even better system for Python developers,
    and Python an even better language for Fedora.
